PROJECT: FOOD FOR THOUGHT
## Inspiration
My Father, Eric Chou, was diagnosed with kidney failure four years ago. 
He was notified that the main issue was due to his nutrition and diet.
I knew that it was an issue but I was not sure what I could do since I was just a little boy. 
However, now that I have learned coding, I have the ability to create an application that can make the process of understanding what foods are good and bad much more simple. 
Through this application, I want to live vicariously through my father's legacy and to create an application that can help others encountering the same problem.
## What it does
It detects images from different foods and analyzes them through databases to determine the effects of certain foods.
## How we built it
It utilizes Google Cloud Platform API and detects images and analyzes the words on it. 
We then utilize a database in order to classify the ingredients in different categories regarding the different possible effects such as cancer, diabetes, headaches, etc. 
After that, we utilized Django in order to link the website with the frontend (html,js,css) with the backend (python). This way, many others can utilize our application.
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into some problems regarding the Django and Html connection.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Object Detection through Deep Learning (GCP API), Django With the Front End, Helping the world encountering similar problems
## What we learned
We learned that coding has a much larger impact than we first expected. The world can be benefitted incredibly through our program. Obesity levels drop, diabetes levels drop, and mortality levels drop. We also learned how to skillfully use Django and GCP API
## What's next for Food For Thought
Future Rollout includes putting the application on the app-store and to get a hosting website for it.
